## Question and Answer

### What is this for?
This is meant to house documentation concerning projects that are being worked on in a transparent fashion.  It also provides some questions about art development.

### Why do you not use confluence?
I do use confluence but I feel for transparency it is easier to work with source control to version control all documentation so I have a "version" of all documentation.  I've noticed that it is easy to lose track of all documentation and notes around a project even in a controlled system due to lack of organization and not having a way to track it.

### Why do you have a mentor?
I don't believe everyone needs a mentor.
Mentor's can give insight to areas one wants improvement in.  Art is very subjective.  The right mentor can aid in taking a person in the right information in order to make their piece better.  Also I feel there is a better trust relationship when taking in information.

### Do you want to work for a studio?
One day.  Though I believe I am just happy just getting the opporunity to work on Art.  If I don't work for a studio then that is just how the ball bounces.

### What areas do you want to improve in?
I simply want to get better at areas I am considered not good at in no particular order:

* Texturing
* Presentation
* Material Contrast
* HLSL

### Do you track time on projects?
I use Harvest time tracking to track time on projects.

### How do you feel about critiques?
Critiques are a great opportunity to get better and get feedback.  They also can be not as helpful as they seem.  I think the overall goal is to focus hard on 80/20 or 90/10 or even 95/5 in order to get desired results.  I just feel that pieces at a certain point have a "point of no return" and don't provide any value after that point.
