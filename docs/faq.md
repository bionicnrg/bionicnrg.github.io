What is this for?

This is meant to house documentation concerning projects that are being worked on in a transparent fashion.

Why do you not use confluence?

I do use confluence but I feel for transparency it is easier to work with source control to version control all documentation so I have a "version" of all documentation.  I've noticed that it is easy to lose track of all documentation and notes around a project even in a controlled system due to lack of organization and not having a way to track it.
