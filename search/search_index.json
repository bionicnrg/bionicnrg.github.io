This is meant to house documentation concerning projects that are being worked on in a transparent fashion. Why do you not use confluence? I do use confluence but I feel for transparency it is easier to work with source control to version control all documentation so I have a \"version\" of all documentation. I've noticed that it is easy to lose track of all documentation and notes around a project even in a controlled system due to lack of organization and not having a way to track it.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"FAQ's What is this for?

This is meant to house documentation concerning projects that are being worked on in a transparent fashion. It also provides some questions about art development. Why do you not use confluence?

I've noticed that it is easy to lose track of all documentation and notes around a project even in a controlled system due to lack of organization and not having a way to track it. Why do you have a mentor? I don't believe everyone needs a mentor. Mentor's can give insight to areas one wants improvement in. Art is very subjective. The right mentor can aid in taking a person in the right information in order to make their piece better. Also I feel there is a better trust relationship when taking in information. Do you want to work for a studio? One day. Though I believe I am just happy just getting the opporunity to work on Art. If I don't work for a studio then that is just how the ball bounces. What areas do you want to improve in? I simply want to get better at areas I am considered not good at in no particular order: Texturing Presentation Material Contrast HLSL Do you track time on projects? I use Harvest time tracking to track time on projects. How do you feel about critiques? Critiques are a great opportunity to get better and get feedback. They also can be not as helpful as they seem. I think the overall goal is to focus hard on 80/20 or 90/10 or even 95/5 in order to get desired results. I just feel that pieces at a certain point have a \"point of no return\" and don't provide any value after that point.","title":"QA"},{"location":"qa/#qa","text":"","title":"QA"},{"location":"qa/#question-and-answer","text":"","title":"Question and Answer"},{"location":"qa/#what-is-this-for","text":"This is meant to house documentation concerning projects that are being worked on in a transparent fashion.
